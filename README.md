**Figure 9 Script - Nitrogen Evolution** 

  This script allows you to input any initial N2 budget (in molecules) and any initial CO2 budget (in mbar) and output the N2 evolution and 15N/14N enrichment plots   with time (from 4 Gya to present-day). 

**Figure 10 Script - Viable Solutions** 

  This script produces the viable solutions that are able to satisfy both of today's abundance and enrichment measurements. It allows you to input an initial N2       budget, initial CO2 budget, multiplicative factor varying the baseline rates of sputtering, volcanic outgassing and photochemical processes and an exponent that     varies the slope of the impact flux model. 

**Figure 11 Script - Rates of Processes**

  This script outputs a plot of the separate rates of the processes for an individual evolutionary track. It allows you to input the specific parameters for that       solution and obtain the variation in each of the rates of the processes.
